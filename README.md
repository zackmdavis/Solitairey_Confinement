When facing a difficult task to do, and given a computer but no internet access (or, less plausibly, a deck of physical playing cards, assuming they even make those anymore), some people procrastinate by playing solitaire.

I procrastinate by writing AIs to play solitaire for me.

Did you know that the entropy of a single playing card is 5.7 bits?? But the entire deck is 225.6 bits!
